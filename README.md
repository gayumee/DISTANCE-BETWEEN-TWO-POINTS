# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: 
Declare 2 values and assign them to the variable x and y.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the result with two floating points 
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```
import math
x1, y1 = 4, 2
x2, y2 = 10, 6
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
print("%.2f"%distance)
```
### OUTPUT:
